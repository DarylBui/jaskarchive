10,Acid Rap,Chance the Rapper,4/30/2013,,"Incredibly formative album for me, really sparked my interest for hip-hop. Incredibly mature for a sophomore album, and wholly unique. No one else could have made this album and no one has been able to make something like it since (not even Chance.)",2013,

9,If You're Reading this it's too Late,Drake,2/13/2015,,"Truly Drake at his best. Something clicked lyrically and every song was just so catchy. Album does not say too much but it does solidify himself as a ""rapper"" despite all of the fraud allegations.",2015,
9,To Pimp a Butterfly,Kendrick Lamar,3/15/2015,,"One of the most influential albums of our generation. Instant classic, and I go back in my mind between 9 and 10. I place it at 9 though because I think there are just some aspects of the album that almost transcend music and in that way it becomes difficult to rate from a listening standpoint. ",2015,1

9,The Life of Pablo,Kanye West,2/14/2016,,"I think this is one of the only times where I listen to Kanye and he does not sound angry. This album, similar to What a Time to be Alive, really does encapsulate the time of release really well. All it is missing is a Drake feature and it would be a perfect time stamps for 2016. Kanye is at his best lyrically and maybe his most mentally stable. He is rapping with nothing to prove and sounds like he is actively enjoying music creation. It is sad to see that we will likely never get more from Kanye in this form",2016,

To produce 5 albums in 5 weeks is insane, but to be actually rap and perform this well in two of them on top of that is unheard of. He works perfectly with Cudi and the decision to keep (almost) all of these projects to a 7 song limit is incredible.

I think that sometimes his ability to discuss important topics shows a bit of immaturity but I do think this adds to the human aspect of a lot of Kendrick's music. He is not perfect and he never has been. He, like all of us, still has a lot to grow but his continued attempt to grow is what makes a lot of his music inspiring.",2022,

I am very happy that he has earned the right to take his time on a project and he definitely delivered. This album is a tasteful sequel to the never story but also manages to be it's own thing with a developed and unique sound. The themes of family / unity throughout tie well with the motif of forever and contradict the idea of individualism and having to make it that is central to The Never Story. Tracks like ""Raydar"" ""Can't Punk Me"" ""Surround Sound"" and ""Bruddamen"" are the standouts for me. I think JID still struggles with slower songs sometimes (""Sistanem"", ""Can't Make U Change"") but overall every one of his performances is extraordinary. Easily AOTY.",,2022,

8,SCARING THE HOES,"JPEGMAFIA, Danny Brown",3/24/2023,"I think that every time I listen to this album, I like it a little more. My only real complaint about the project is that I wish more was said. Most of the topics are just commentary on the music industry and how it has grown stale. I also wish that Danny Brown had a few more opppurtunities to shine. Overall though, this album  is incredibly. Every song is very unique both against themselves and the industry as a whole. ""Scaring the Hoes"", ""Lean Beef Patty"", ""Burfict!"" are standouts for me but it I am a fan of almost every track. The energy and perspective this album provides is much needed in the scene and I hope it can be influential for albums to come this year.",,2023,

The cast for this album all perform at an acceptable level.",,2023,

7,"I was mature for my age, but I was still a child",grouptherapy.,6/27/2023,It is sad that given the name of this album it feels so immature. A lot of the lyrics and thoughts that the songs have feel really close to being something but do not quite get there. It leaves me excited for future projects!,,2023,

6,Barbie the Album,Various Artists,7/21/2023,,,2023,
7,Utopia,Travis Scott,7/28/2023,"Sufferers from a similar problem to Donna/Kanye where Travis often feels like the most forgettable / weakest part of songs. Lyrically there is not much to pick apart, Travis offers very little of impact or value aside from ""My Eyes"". The features for this project are larger in name than Astroworld (Beyoncé, Carti, Future, Badbunny) but their impact feels much smaller.  Overall, when the songs are put against each other I still think they are sonically unique and interesting and I think the album is definitely worth a listen / enjoyable. I wish we got more from Travis given the large gap between projects but I am glad we did not just get Astroworld 2. ",,2023,
8,The Patience,Mick Jenkins,8/18/2023,"Mick sounds so hungry on this project. The aggression we hear from him is something that I think there has not been too much of in the past. I think this works well on a lot of the tracks but a few do fall short (""ROY G. BIV, Farm to Table""). Overall, the project is still super enjoyable and ""smoke break"" might be my favorite track of the year. Every feature delivers and works incredibly well with Mick but I do not think any really outshine him which is great. I wish the project was longer but I understand and respect that Mick kept it to this length.",,2023,
7,Tesla,Lil Yachty,8/25/2023,He is really stepping into his own as a producer and artist. He proves that he can hold his own with some of the best and still spit verses which contradicts his last project pretty heavily. A fun little project to hold us over til a (hopeful) album in the coming years.,,2023,
8,How Do You Sleep at Night?,Teezo Touchdown,9/8/2023,"Very interesting project for a ""debut"" album. I really admire that Teezo did not go crazy with features all though it seems like he very easily could have. I think the production really carries here as a lot of the lyrics are relatively immature and at times even cringe (especially when you realizes Teezo is 30). I don't hold that against the album too much however considering Teezo does not seem to be taking himself very seriously here. It seems like he is having fun and there are (hopefully intentional) undertones of humor throughout. ""Too Easy, Familiarity, Sweet"" are standouts for me and this album leaves me excited to see what Teezo will do in the future.",,2023,

5,Tha Fix Before the IV,Lil Wayne,9/28/2023,"The beats are actually very interesting, especially for a lil wayne project but the lowlights on this album are just so low. ""Kat Food"" and ""Tity Boi"" are just incredibly outdated tracks. I like ""birds"" and ""act up"". Obviously this is not a legitimate project and just Wayne releasing some loonies before the big album, given the name, but even then I was relatively disappointed. Comparing this to similar projects (mostly untitled unmastered) this really falls short.",,2023,
5,For All the Dogs,Drake,10/6/2023,"I think this project is more creative / exciting than a lot of Drake's recent work, but 23 tracks is still WAYY too much. Drake has never and probably will never have the ability to entertain me for 1.5 straight hours. A portion of this album listens like a break-up album but the feelings that Drake conveys are so elementary (especially for a 36 year old) that it is pretty sad. Most of the conclusions of these break up tracks is just ""i hate u, you don't deserve me, you're immature"" but maybe if drake stopped dating women 10 years younger than him he would not have this issue. He needs way more introspection. I think all the features and highlights of this album (""First person shooter"", ""Slime you out"", ""members only"", ""IDGAF"") are too good for me to dip below 5 but it was close. ",,2023,

7,And Then You Pray For Me,Westside Gunn,10/13/2023,Never really gotten that into westside gunn but heard this album + pray for paris were really good so I checked them out. I do think both projects are unique and entertaining. I think that this one specifically is a bit on the long side. I imagine a lot of my feelings about this project being repetitive comes from the fact that I listened to it so quickly after Pray for Paris instead of 3 years after so i wont let that detract from the project too much. Overall very fun project and westside is in great form + utilizes features to keep every track interesting,,2023,
6,Lahai,Sampha,10/20/2023,,,2023,
6,Slime in the Ice Machine,"Ameer Van, Merlyn Wood",10/27/2023,I don't know if it is because I had the lowest expectations ever but this album was actually pleasantly surprising. I liked several tracks and Ameer + Merlyn have always worked well together. I think the title / concept is a little cringey but I think it has a nice sound overall,,2023,
5,Larger than Life,Brent Faiyaz,10/27/2023,Feel like this album really flew under the radar. Did not hear much discussion about it anywhere. I think that it was an ok project overall but I guess at this point for Brent I am looking for more. I do not think this lives up to wasteland and it for sure does not live up to Fuck the World,,2023,
4,Blanket,Kevin Abstract,11/3/2023,,,2023,
8,Heaven Knows,PinkPantheress,11/10/2023,"PinkPanthress' ability to create her own sound in this hyper-pop / hip-hop indie sphere is really incredible. I think that the areas she lacks in most is lyrical depth but it is never enough to distract or take away from a track. Probably one of the best debut albums I have ever heard and I really doubt anyone else could produce / create something like it. I hope that this will propel them to be a more household name and am very excited for future work. I think a few tracks could be cut (Ophelia, Blue, Feel Complete) as they seem to accomplish similar goals to other tracks but I understand why the track list is the length it is. I also feel like Boys a Liar is so out of place on the track list but it is probably just thrown in for streaming number purposes which is acceptable especially for a smaller artist. It is pretty crazy how old / dated boys a liar sounds though, really goes to show how much she has been able to develop her own sound in such a short time, very excited for what is to come, contender for AOTY.",,2023,1
7,Quaranta,Danny Brown,11/17/2023,"I think my main critique of Scaring the Hoes was that Danny Brown's role was minimized / he did not have a chance to speak about anything meaningful. With that in mind, this album really delivers. Danny Brown touches on so much about his life and his place in the rap game right now. I think the juxtaposition of his ""normal"" voice and high pitched voice was a little jarring at first but I think overall it is done really well. I think a few of the tracks could use more depth (Hanami, Down Wit it) as they discuss some heavy topics but do not break them down to the level of detail I desired. The bars throughout the project are phenomenal though and seeing an older rapper actually evolve / discuss topics relevant to their age is really refreshing.",,2023,

4,Pink Friday 2,Nicki Minaj,12/8/2023,"This project is way too bloated, 22 tracks is a LOT. I think that the second half is a lot stronger than the first but it still falls flat. A lot of the features / sample flips really disappoint / underperform as well. Nicki's rapping on the project is good but not anything we haven't already seen her do before / do better. ",,2023,
6,american spirit,21 Savage,1/11/2024,Lots of sampling on this project (ty kanye) and I was kinda getting bored through it but it was good. Wish there was a J cole feature  or just more interesting features in general but feel like this is a pretty typical project i expect from 21.,,2024,
4,Insano,Kid Cudi,1/11/2024,I am personally more of a fan of when Cudi leans into this voice and focuses on singing rather than rapping. With that being said this album is pretty dissapointing and it was hard to find places that I really liked / could see myself revisiting.,,2024,
6,All is Yellow,Lyrical Lemonade,1/25/2024,"This project feels very 2016, in a good way. I really enjoyed the listen and hearing from some artists I have not heard from in a while. Excited to watch the videos as that is obviously a large part of this project. Glad this came together and got some fun tracks out of it, did not expect much else when it was announced.",,2024,

6,Vultures 1,"Kanye West, Ty Dolla Sign",2/9/2024,Sigh. This album is so weird. I think that the highs on it are really good and it actually doesn't have the worst lows. But the lyricism (especially by Kanye but sometimes by guests) is SO BAD. It also feels so weird coming after donda where I would argue Kanye had pretty good lyricism. I don't think this album does anything special and I really hope that there are no more versions of it. Ty Dolla $ performed really well but I am not the biggest fan of him and his lyrics make me uncomfortable.,,2024,

8,BLUE LIPS,Schoolboy Q,3/1/2024,This was not the sound I was expecting from this album but I really like it. I think Thank god 4 me is the most interesting song I have heard this year and I find myself revisiting it as well as the project as a whole. I think the back half of the project is a bit weaker than the start and that holds me back rom giving it a 9 but I think it could change as I continue to revisti,,2024,
8,WE DON'T TRUST YOU,"Future, Metro Boomin",3/22/2024,"At this point, I think metro has solidified himself as the greatest produced of the modern era. I had high expectations for him for this project and he managed to deliver some interesting beats, great sample flips and overall entertainment for the entire length of the project. Metro did nothing to really impress me, but I think this just speaks to how good he has become. A project of this caliber is the expectation for Metro and probably unattainable by any other producer right now. Future managed to pleasantly surprise me. I did not expect a 40 year old future to keep up with bars for the length of this project but I think that he delivered. My only complaint for this album is that it seems a bit front-loaded with its big moments / surprises (Kendrick feature, Like That, Young Thug cameo, Travis Feature etc.). ",,2024,
6,Tyla,Tyla,3/22/2024,Did not come into this project with any real idea about Tyla's sound / any real expectations. From that perspective I think the project does a good job of establishing her sound and I think it is fitting as a self titled project. They seemed to be relatively restrained with length and feature usage which is always commendable. I don't think this sound is necessarily something I seek out or know too much about but I liked a lot of the tracks and see myself revisiting them.,,2024,
8,Mika's Laundry,Matt Champion,3/22/2024,,,2024,
5,Might Delete Later,J. Cole,4/5/2024,I was unbeleivably excited for this album due to all of the promotion and unexpected rop. I thought this would be a collection of loosies and that the fall off was soon to follow. It seems instead that this was a rushed project to help get more attention in the midst of ongoing rap beef. I think J. Cole mishandled the beef and that this project is clearly unpolished. Wish he had just released the single track and discussed his thought on the rap beef. This was a real legacy hurter,,2024,
4,Bryson Tiller,Bryson Tiller,4/5/2024,Artists need to stop making self titled projects unless they are truly trying to create a representation of themselves. This project was boring and misogynistic,,2024,
6,It's Us Vol. 1,Concret Boys,4/5/2024,I liked this project and was lucky enough to see a lot of the concrete family live at coachella. I think that the goal of this project was just to have fun and get some recognition for some of the non-yatchy memebrs. I think it did a good job of this.,,2024,
4,WE STILL DON'T TRUST YOU,"Metro Boomin, Future",4/12/2024,This project is so long and feels really uneccessary. I think it seriously detracts from the strength of WE DONT TRUST YOU. I think it could have been fun and good but there were just soo many tracks and it was difficult for me to stay engaged. I would definetly just have perferred a deluxe for the original rather than an entire 24 track seperate project.,,2024,
6,u made me a st4r,4batz,5/3/2024,I think the hype got to lil bro's head. I do think this album has some great tracks (mainly the singles) but aside from that there is a lot of room for growth. I think the features (both Drake's and Kanye's) are actually terrible. Feel like there is a lot of wasted potential there and i hope that this is not too big of a hit to his career. Hope he bounces back,,2024,
6,14 minutes,Dominic Fike,5/3/2024,I actually really liked basically every track on this project I just wish it was longer and more thematically cohesive. Clearly just a collection of loosies,,2024,
4,One of Wun,Gunna,5/10/2024,"Gunna just releases such huge overwhelming projects.

5,Naked.,Perry Maysun,2/29/2024,"This project is pretty interesting. Saw this guy's tiktok, effectively he is a cancer patient who is very young (22).

8,HARDSTONE PSYCHO,Don Toliver,6/14/2024,"I really enjoyed this album. Feel like I have never been able to get into Don but this project really showed me why people like him so much. Don is obviously the quintasential feature artist with every hiphop album of late haivng a government mandated Don Toliver feaure, so it is nice to see him shine on his own tracks with intersting beats. I think the album is long but it kept me invested and was interesting enough that I gave it several listens. Definetly will be revisiting throughout the year.",,2024,
8,HIT ME HARD AND SOFT,Billie Eilish,6/14/2024,Billie is one of the artists that puts genuine thought and care into crafting every single album. She could easily release a 22 track mess and get millions of streams but I really respect this project. A no feature introspective album that touches on a lot of her struggles in a much more mature way. I think the intro does a great job of setting the tone and I think a lot of Billie fans will love this project,,2024,

9,Bando Stone and the New World,Childish Gambino,7/19/2024,"The only thing holding this project back from being a 10 for me is that the narrative is not cohesive. I feel like there is the movie narrative + this other thread of gambino becoming a father and living his life and finding love. They feel disconnected to me, but maybe the movie's release will clear that up and this will retroactively improve. Amazing album tho, really innovative and interesting sound and every song kept me engaged and felt holistic even though they are so different",,2024,

6,Ultra 85,Logic,8/9/2024,Not personally a fan of this project but I appreciate that Logic is not afraid to discuss topics that other rappers shy away from. Lots of personal cuts and I think this would be  a great project for a Logic fan. Lots of interesting and fun beats and even I was never really bored throughout this 20 track project.

8,Alligator Bites Never Heal,Doechii,8/30/2024,I usually really don't like Boom Bap style music but this album was so good. My only complaints are that all the songs are so short. Doechii's flows are up their with the best and the pockets she manages to find are really fun. I think the beat selection is good but the first half outshines the second for me,,2024,

5,Better MeThan You,Big Sean,8/30/2024,This album just leaves me wondering what happened to BIg Sean.
